## 📖 What is telephone-and-conversation-transcriber?

This project is a real-time speech-to-text app designed for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. It runs on a Raspberry Pi with a 10-inch touchscreen. The device listens during phone calls and room conversations, then quickly shows what is being said as captions on the screen.

This solution helps people who cannot hear clearly to follow conversations without needing extra help. It uses speech recognition technology to turn spoken words into text almost instantly.

---

## 💻 System Requirements

To use this software, you will need:

- A Raspberry Pi computer (Model 3 or newer recommended)
- A 10-inch touchscreen compatible with Raspberry Pi (for displaying captions)
- A microphone or phone adapter to capture audio
- Internet access (for some speech recognition features)
- A power source for the Raspberry Pi
- A microSD card with at least 16GB storage space

You do not need programming skills. Basic experience in turning on devices and clicking on buttons is enough.
